 <h1>The Best Movies According to Nick</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
 <h3>Tommy Boy</h3>
 <p>A favorite due to Chris Farley and his stupid humor. I used to be able to quote this movie in its entirety.
</p>
 <h3>Boondock Saints</h3>
 <p>An action movie with a lot of blood and shooting. I enjoy the humor that is sprinkled in.</p>

 <h3>Clerks</h3>
 <p>A movie that proved you do not need a lot of money to make a hit. I also enjoyed Clerks 2 and 3.</p>
